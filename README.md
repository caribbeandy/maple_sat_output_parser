### Synopsis

> The Maple series of SAT solvers are a family of conflict-driven clause-learning SAT solvers for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem. The key innovation of these solvers is the use of the **learning rate branching heuristic (LRB)**, a departure from the VSIDS branching heuristic that has been the status quo for the past decade of SAT solving [1].

This script is intended to parses the output from the Maple series of SAT solvers and outputs the features into a CSV.
